  abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase the average water temperature and alter the ecology and physiology of several organisms including fish species. To examine the effects of increased water temperature on freshwater fish reproduction, adult European bullhead Cottus gobio of both genders were maintained under three temperature regimes (T1: 6\textendash 10, T2: 10\textendash 14 and T3: 14\textendash 18\textdegree C) and assessed for gonad development (gonadosomatic index\textemdash GSI and gonad histology), sex steroids (testosterone\textemdash T, 17{$\beta$}-estradiol\textemdash E2 and 11-ketotestosterone\textemdash 11-KT) and vitellogenin (alkali-labile phosphoprotein phosphorus\textemdash ALP) dynamics in December, January, February and March. The results indicate that a 8\textdegree C rise in water temperature (T3) deeply disrupted the gonadal maturation in both genders. This observation was associated with the absence of GSI peak from January to March, and low levels of plasma sex steroids compared with T1-exposed fish. Nevertheless, exposure to an increasing temperature of 4\textdegree C (T2) appeared to accelerate oogenesis with an early peak value in GSI and level of plasma T recorded in January relative to T1-exposed females. In males, the low GSI, reduced level of plasma 11-KT and the absence of GSI increase from January to March support the deleterious effects of increasing water temperature on spermatogenesis. The findings of the present study suggest that exposure to elevated temperatures within the context of climate warming might affect the reproductive success of C. gobio. Specifically, a 4\textdegree C rise in water temperature affects gametogenesis by advancing the spawning, and a complete reproductive failure is observed at an elevated temperature of 8\textdegree C.},

  abstract = {1. The chief objective was to determine the upper and lower thermal limits for feeding and survival in the stone loach, Noemacheilus barbatulus, using juveniles (total length 30\textendash 45 mm, live weight 0.25\textendash 0.80 g) from one population and adults (total length 77\textendash 100 mm, live weight 3.6\textendash 7.9 g) from three populations.2. Fish were acclimatized to constant temperatures of 3, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 27\textdegree C; then the temperature was changed at a rate of 1\textdegree C/30min to determine the critical limits for feeding, survival over 7 days (incipient lethal temperature), or survival for 10 min or less (ultimate lethal temperature). The rate of 1\textdegree C/30min was the optimum value from preliminary experiments, using nine rates from 0.5\textdegree C/48h to 18\textdegree Ch-1. As values for adults were not significantly different between populations, they were pooled to provide arithmetic means (with 95\% CL) for the thermal limits at each acclimation temperature.3. Feeding limits increased with acclimation temperature to upper and lower mean values of 28.0 {$\pm$} 0.15\textdegree C and 5.1 {$\pm$} 0.55\textdegree C for adults, 25.0 {$\pm$} 0.54\textdegree C and 6.1 {$\pm$} 0.92\textdegree C for juveniles. Incipient lethal levels defined a tolerance zone within which stone loach survive for a considerable time; upper limits increased with acclimation temperature to reach a maximum plateau of 29.1 {$\pm$} 0.18\textdegree C for adults and 29.0 {$\pm$} 0.40\textdegree C for juveniles; lower limits also increased from near 0\textdegree C to 3.0 {$\pm$} 0.40\textdegree C for adults and juveniles. Upper limits for the ultimate lethal level increased with acclimation temperature to a maximum plateau of 33.5\textdegree C for adults (95\% CL {$\pm$} 0.19) and juveniles (95\% CL {$\pm$} 0.40), whilst the lower limits increased from near 0\textdegree C to 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.30\textdegree C. At acclimation temperatures below 20\textdegree C, upper incipient and ultimate lethal values were significantly lower for juveniles than those for adults.4. The thermal tolerance of stone loach was higher than that of juvenile Atlantic salmon or brown trout, one or both of these species often being dominant in streams with stone loach.},
